# prediction-ML
this repository contains some of my projects which i have done one my own. These are tasks of an internship programme form GRIP foundation.

1. The study_hours-marks.py file predicts the marks of a student based on the number of hours he/she has studied. Used linear regression to predict.
2. The iris_data.py file is an example of clustering data using KMeans and finding the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
